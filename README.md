Prequel

This program is run once before the zwhome custom automation program. It identifies the devices in a z-wave network and lets you name them and their location. The program can be run whenever a new Z-Wave module is added.

See the installation instructions for zwHome at https://github.com/obzerving/zwhome for building the development environment.
